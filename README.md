GenerateLineMap Task for MSBuild
=====================================

Adds GenerateLineMap to Visual Studio 2013/2017 for automated builds.
As the first version of this utility, there really aren't any options for it.

Getting Started
---------------

Use Nuget to add GenerateLineMap.MSBuild.Task to your Visual Studio project:

```
Install-Package GenerateLineMap.MSBuild.Task
```

Build your project. The merged assembly will be stored in an LineMapped folder under your project output.
